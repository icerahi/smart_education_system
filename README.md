IOT based Smart Education System.

It was an initial prototype of a centralized primary
smart education system where a classroom’s whiteboard will be replaced
with a single board computer’s display that is known here as Node. The node
would be connected with the central server application and it would be
continuously sending and receiving all real-time data to Server Dashboard.
Central Dashboard had the ability to control and monitor the activity of node
devices. The full system cycle would be automated and node application
would be voice-controlled.
